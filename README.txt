Code to find and classify features on the Si(001):H:AsH3 surface. 
Only finds and classifies step edges, dark features (dimer vacancies), single dangling bond, double dangling bond, anomaly, arsenic atom.
If a bright feature is next to a dimer vacancy, it is left unclassified.

Install the requirements.txt folder using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
Install pytorch version 2.4.0 using conda and the command snippet given on the pytorch website.
